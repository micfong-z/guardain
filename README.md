_This is a Hackathon project for [CUES x CUABC x CAISH x CUE Hackathon 2025](https://cues-hackathon-2025.devpost.com/). Not intended for production._

**GuardAIn** is a context-aware AI safety companion that combines real-time data from multiple sources to provide intelligent, personalized route recommendations. At its core, GuardAIn performs multi-factor context analysis by aggregating UK Police crime statistics for any location, checking current weather conditions including visibility and precipitation, calculating day/night status with sunrise and sunset times.

What makes GuardAIn different is that it doesn't just display data—it thinks. Using Claude AI with our custom MCP server, it identifies dangerous combinations that matter for real-world safety. For example, it understands that dark plus foggy conditions in a high theft area creates elevated risk, while daytime with good visibility on a main road presents lower concern.
